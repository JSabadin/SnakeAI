# AI Snake Game Player

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent designed to play the classic Snake game. It uses PyTorch for constructing and training the neural network and a custom Snake game environment coded in Python. The DQN agent learns to navigate the game, avoid obstacles, and collect food through reinforcement learning.
